		<h1>This is a game about a dystopian futuristic world in which the government has enlisted a security system that watches over all of the population. They tell their citizens it is for the good of the world and to prevent crime and keep everyone safer. However, you play as a hacker called Grey who knows better than to trust these people. You play alongside a narrator that narrates every action you take and every environment you come across. The narrator will be revealed at a later date however for now he is a tongue in cheek voice-over that criticises you and also helps you along the way. The main goal of your objective is to find the system in the vault on the bottom floor and shut it down forever. There are many ways to make it down there so each play through should feel different. Good luck and I hope you succeed.</h1>
